## **Design & Interaction Notes**

* **Design Language:** Dark base + neon gradients for energy (space/launch aesthetic)
* **Animations:** Subtle hover zoom on cards, fade-in on scroll
* **Consistency:** All project thumbnails use a similar framing so the grid looks clean
* **Mobile UX:** Stack sections vertically, filters collapse into dropdowns
* **Brand Visuals:** Rocket/launch motifs subtly integrated but not cartoonish
