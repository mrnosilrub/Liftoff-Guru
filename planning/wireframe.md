## About

```
[Header]
  H1: About Liftoff.Guru
  Intro: We started Liftoff.Guru to build a lot of small, useful things—then scale the winners. We keep cycles short, learn quickly, and let real usage guide decisions.

[Who we are]
  - Elias Burlison — R&D Analyst and Project Manager in scrap aluminum processing, working with emerging sortation technologies for non‑ferrous metals. Founder of Scrapyard Sites (scrapyardsites.com).
  - Shawn Spretke — Engineer at a medical device company; designs braiders for stents and catheters. Co‑founder of Starko (starkotech.com).

[Build philosophy]
  - Launch fast, learn faster.
  - Obsess over clarity.
  - Practical > perfect.
